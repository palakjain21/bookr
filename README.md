# About the Project

This is a minimal FullStack Web Application, whose primary function will be a cloud platform for people all around the world, where they can sign in, create a private collection for their E-Books (Right now we're aiming for PDFs only), and read/continue it from wherever they want and whenever they want.

## Tech Stack

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the default package manager
* [React](https://reactjs.org) with [TypeScript](typescriptlang.org)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for Authentication, Object Storage and Database
* [Vercel's](https://vercel.com) serverless functions for API Routes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Contributing

You'll need a basic knowledge of atleast one of the tech stacks mentioned above, as issues can require knowledge of a single one of them, or a combination of some.
